Documentation structure
----------------------- 

This document is structured into a tutorial and two major sections: a User's guide and a Developer's guide:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   tutorials
   user/users-guide
   developer/developer-guide
   
The tutorial will help the new user's and developers orient themselves to fates.  Each major section then follows a common structure of three sub-sections: 

- How-to: Straight forward recipes for common tasks
- Overview: Narrative discussions of the concepts
- Reference: Description of specific code procedures and routines

This structure adapts the Divio documentation framework.  For information on how this document is structured, see https://documentation.divio.com/.

Technical Documentation
-----------------------

The :doc:`fates-doc:fates_tech_note` detailing the scientific underpinning of the model is hosted as a Read The Docs :doc:`rtd:subprojects` within this User's Guide.  As a subproject both the guide and the techincal documentation are searchable through the index in the User's Guide.
