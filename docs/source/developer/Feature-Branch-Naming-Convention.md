# Feature branch naming convention

Branch naming will be similar (but not same, we use dashes not slashes) to those used on the ACME project.

`<gitusername>-<component>-<description>`


Example, user rgknox wants to create a branch to implement the addition of new output variables that have special size-structured dimension.  The branch would be called:

`rgknox-IO-sizestructuredoutput`
