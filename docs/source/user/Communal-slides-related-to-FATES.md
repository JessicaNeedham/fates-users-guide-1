# FATES-relevant slide archive

This is a location to keep presentation material related to FATES design, applications, testing, planning etc. The idea being that we all have a collective resource from which to draw when writing talks etc.   Illustrating the collaborative nature of FATES development should be a win-win, in that more people will want to work with the model, increasing model utility, citations to publications, etc.

## Crediting Slides accessed here.

* For <b>results/diagrams/hypotheses that could in principle be published</b>, credit for the work should be clearly labeled on the slide (if desired).  **It is a condition of using this material that these credits not be removed**. Where possible, such contributions should be highlighted (e.g on title slides, in acknowledgements, etc.).  

* For <b>more basic slides, e.g. text or simple diagrams</b>, specific credit on each slide is not necessary, but co-authorships from material copied here should be given on the title slide. Authorship is assumed to be the first author of the presentations uploaded here. If additional credit is required, this should be stated in a slide at the beginning of the slide deck. 

* Smaller collections of clearly labeled slides are preferable to very long talks. Slide formats should ideally be google drive links. 

* These guidelines are an attempt to make explicit what is normally considered implicit, and therefore promote sharing of credit and broad publicizing of our efforts. 

* Please add an 'issue' if you want to discuss any of the above more broadly.  This is intended as a 'straw man' idea.
