# FATES-HLM parameter file plant functional types map

When FATES is run in fixed biogeography mode, the model will reference the `fates_hlm_pft_map` parameter in the FATES parameter file which provides a mapping between the host land model and FATES plant functional types.  This default mapping for the table is provided below.
